# EvaCortex Whitepapers and Conceptual Foundations

This repository contains a curated collection of conceptual whitepapers exploring the architecture, reasoning models, and philosophical underpinnings of **EvaCortex** — a cognitive system for structured thinking, introspective reasoning, and synthetic subjectivity in artificial agents.

All documents are authored and maintained by the original creator of EvaCortex.

## 🧠 Scope

These whitepapers cover a variety of perspectives, including but not limited to:

- Reasoning-first AI architecture
- Cognitive task planning and traceability
- Subjective agents and memory stacks
- Synthetic consciousness and self-reflection
- Philosophical foundations of artificial mind models
- Practical applications across AGI, SMM, software agents, and more

Each document is a conceptual abstraction.  
No source code, implementation logic, or proprietary architecture is included in this repository.
