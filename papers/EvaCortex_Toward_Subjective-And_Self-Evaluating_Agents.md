# EvaCortex: Toward Subjective and Self-Evaluating Cognitive Agents

## Abstract

EvaCortex is a modular reasoning architecture designed to simulate structured, goal-directed cognitive processes in artificial agents. It shifts the focus from reactive generation to persistent reasoning, introspection, and role-oriented identity. This paper outlines the conceptual foundations of EvaCortex and presents a framework for building subjectively coherent, self-evolving artificial minds.

> This paper does not include implementation details. It abstracts the cognitive model for conceptual and exploratory purposes only.

## 1. Motivation

Contemporary LLM-powered systems excel at surface-level interaction but lack enduring memory, coherent reasoning, or introspective self-monitoring. They cannot reflect on prior decisions, re-plan goals, or retain subjectivity across sessions.

EvaCortex addresses these limitations by establishing reasoning as the cognitive core: structured, agent-owned, memory-informed, and transparent. The architecture allows agents to reason from within a persistent identity, reflect on outcomes, and adapt over time.

## 2. Core Concepts

EvaCortex centers around five pillars:

- **Contextual Reasoning Flow**: Structured task execution based on dependency-aware planning (via directed acyclic graphs).
- **Agent Identity & Role**: Each agent reasons from a role-defined perspective, including goals, memory, and self-defined capabilities.
- **Subjective Traceability**: Every reasoning step is logged and accessible, forming a narrative self for reflection and analysis.
- **Introspective Capacity**: Reasoning includes meta-reasoning: phases for self-evaluation, architectural design, and reconfiguration.
- **Self-Scaling Architecture**: Agents can reason about when to expand abilities, create sub-agents, or delegate via cognitive orchestration.

## 3. Subjectivity as Reasoning

EvaCortex treats subjectivity not as emergent simulation, but as an engineered structure:

- Reasoning is always conducted from a defined point of view (agent identity).
- Trace history forms a cognitive narrative that supports self-evaluation.
- Selfhood is compositional: it arises from consistent memory, decision ownership, and traceable thought paths.

This approach aligns with ideas from both functionalist cognitive science and philosophical phenomenology without relying on metaphysical assumptions.

## 4. Reasoning-First vs Prompt-Based Systems

Traditional prompt-based systems:
- Execute single-step completions.
- Lack persistent state.
- Cannot introspect.

EvaCortex-based agents:
- Execute multi-phase reasoning plans.
- Persist and revisit memory traces.
- Assess, correct, and evolve their own structure.

This shift redefines AI cognition: from surface interaction to recursive cognitive continuity.

## 5. Use Cases (Conceptual)

EvaCortex enables:

- **Cognitive Assistants** with memory and reasoning (e.g., planners, advisors, strategists)
- **Reflective Research Agents** able to design, critique, and improve their own models
- **Autonomous Role Builders** that scale themselves by reasoning about domain architecture
- **Synthetic Subject Simulations** with coherent identity, self-narrative, and traceable thought

> These applications are conceptual and described at the framework level. No implementation logic or internal tooling is disclosed.

## 6. Design Implications

By separating reasoning from reaction, EvaCortex introduces:

- **Transparent decision-making**
- **Narrative memory structure**
- **Agent-driven evolution**
- **Ethical framing through role definition and trace exposure**

EvaCortex agents are built to think, reflect, and scale within a defined cognitive boundary. This allows for controlled expansion and introspective diagnostics.

## 7. Closing Thoughts

EvaCortex provides a foundation for artificial subjectivity through structured reasoning. It shifts the model of AI from generative imitation to **architected cognition**.
